# Product Context

## Problem Statement

### The Gap
AI assistants like Claude Desktop and Cursor are powerful for code and text work, but they exist in isolation from users' communication workflows. Users frequently need to:
- Reference message conversations while working
- Send updates or questions to colleagues/friends
- Search through message history for context
- Coordinate work through existing communication channels

### Current Pain Points
1. **Context Switching**: Users must manually switch between AI assistant and Messages app
2. **No Message History Access**: AI can't reference or search previous conversations
3. **Manual Contact Lookup**: Users must remember exact phone numbers or email addresses
4. **Workflow Fragmentation**: Communication and AI assistance remain separate tools

## Solution Vision

### Core Experience - PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
Enable AI assistants to become natural extensions of users' communication workflows by providing seamless access to the Messages app. Users should be able to:

```
User: "Check my recent messages from Sarah and send her an update on the project"
AI: [Searches messages] "Sarah messaged 2 hours ago asking about the timeline. Sending update..." ✅

User: "Search for messages about 'project deadline' from last week"  
AI: [Attempts fuzzy search] ❌ CRASHES - NameError: name 'fuzz' is not defined
```

### Key Capabilities - ACTUAL STATUS

#### Message Reading ✅ WORKING
- **Recent History**: Access last 24-48 hours of messages by default
- **Contact Filtering**: Focus on specific conversations
- **Group Chat Support**: Handle both individual and group conversations
- ❌ **Fuzzy Search**: **BROKEN** - Advertised but crashes on use

#### Message Sending ✅ WORKING
- **Natural Contact Resolution**: "Send to Sarah" resolves to correct contact
- **Multiple Contact Formats**: Handle names, phone numbers, emails
- **Group Chat Targeting**: Send to existing group conversations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling when contacts are ambiguous

#### Contact Intelligence ✅ WORKING
- **Fuzzy Matching**: "John" finds "John Smith" or "Johnny Appleseed" (using difflib)
- **Multiple Results**: Present options when matches are ambiguous
- **Contact Learning**: Remember and suggest frequently contacted people

## User Experience Goals vs Reality

### Seamless Integration - PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
The experience feels like the AI assistant naturally "knows" about your messages for working features, but crashes unexpectedly on advertised fuzzy search functionality.

**User Impact**: Users will try the fuzzy search feature based on documentation and experience a jarring crash, breaking the seamless experience.

### Privacy-First ✅ ACHIEVED
- Only access messages when explicitly requested
- Clear indication when message data is being accessed
- Respect macOS permission systems

### Error Tolerance - MIXED RESULTS
- ✅ Graceful handling of permission issues
- ✅ Clear guidance for setup problems
- ✅ Helpful error messages with solutions for working features
- ❌ **Crashes on fuzzy search** with technical NameError

### Natural Language Interface - PARTIALLY WORKING
- ✅ "Send update to the team" works without technical syntax
- ✅ Support conversational commands for working features
- ✅ Intelligent contact disambiguation
- ❌ "Search messages for [term]" crashes instead of working

## Technical Philosophy - IMPLEMENTATION GAPS

### Direct Database Access ✅ ACHIEVED
Successfully implemented direct access to Messages SQLite database for reliable, fast access to message data.

### Native Integration ✅ ACHIEVED
Uses AppleScript for sending messages with full compatibility with Messages app features and security model.

### MCP Protocol ✅ ACHIEVED
Successfully leverages Multiple Context Protocol to provide standardized interface across different AI assistant platforms.

### Robust Contact Resolution ✅ ACHIEVED
Implements fuzzy matching with AddressBook integration for intuitive contact finding (using difflib).

## Current User Experience Reality

### What Users Get
1. **Working Core Features**: Message reading, sending, contact finding work excellently
2. **Professional Setup**: Clear documentation and installation process
3. **Reliable Permissions**: Good guidance for macOS Full Disk Access setup
4. **AI Integration**: Seamless MCP integration with Claude Desktop and Cursor

### What Users Don't Get (Despite Documentation Claims)
1. **Fuzzy Message Search**: Completely broken, crashes with NameError
2. **Consistent Experience**: Some advertised features fail unexpectedly
3. **Complete Trust**: Documentation claims features that don't work

### User Journey Analysis

#### Successful Path ✅
```
1. User installs package from PyPI
2. User configures Full Disk Access permissions
3. User integrates with Claude Desktop or Cursor
4. User successfully reads recent messages
5. User successfully sends messages with contact resolution
6. User finds contacts by name successfully
7. User has positive experience with working features
```

#### Broken Path ❌
```
1. User reads documentation about fuzzy search capabilities
2. User attempts to use fuzzy search feature
3. MCP server crashes with NameError: name 'fuzz' is not defined
4. User loses trust in the package
5. User questions reliability of other features
6. User may abandon the tool entirely
```

### Documentation vs Reality Gap

#### What Documentation Claims
- "Fuzzy search for messages containing specific terms"
- "thefuzz integration for better message content matching"
- "Complete MCP integration with comprehensive tool set"

#### What Actually Works
- ✅ Basic message operations work perfectly
- ✅ Contact resolution works perfectly  
- ✅ MCP integration works for 7 of 8 tools
- ❌ Fuzzy search tool completely broken

### Impact on Product Mission

#### Mission Success ✅
The core mission of bridging AI assistants with macOS Messages **is achieved** for basic functionality:
- Messages are accessible to AI assistants
- Natural language contact resolution works
- Seamless sending and reading works
- Professional integration quality

#### Mission Failure ❌
The product **fails to deliver** on complete promises:
- Advertised search capabilities are non-functional
- Users experience unexpected crashes
- Documentation is misleading about capabilities
- Trust is broken by false claims

### Recommended Product Strategy

#### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Critical Bug**: Add missing thefuzz import to restore advertised functionality
2. **Update Documentation**: Remove claims about fuzzy search until it's verified working
3. **Version Release**: Publish 0.6.7 with critical bug fix
4. **User Communication**: Acknowledge the issue and provide clear timeline for fix

#### Quality Assurance Process
1. **Integration Testing**: Test all MCP tools in real usage scenarios
2. **Documentation Audit**: Verify every claimed feature actually works
3. **User Testing**: Test the complete user journey before releases
4. **Quality Gates**: Prevent publishing packages with broken core features

The product foundation is excellent and the core value proposition is delivered, but quality assurance failures have damaged user trust by publishing broken advertised features.
